description: "In her 1985 essay A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late 20th Century, Donna Haraway uses the term \"cyborg\" as a metaphor for contemporary existence and it's blurry boundaries. Her idea of a cyborg is \"a condensed image of both imagination and material reality\" and \"resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity. It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence.\" Haraway believes that traditional dualisms are no longer relevant for citizens of the future. The projects below responded to this theme in a variety of ways. Some outline plausible products and services that augment everyday experiences with technology, while others features cyborg characters from sensational and futuristic worlds. Other projects deal with hybridity in more tangential ways, playing with dualities like analog/digital, interior/exterior, and human/animal."
