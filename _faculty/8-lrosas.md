Leanna Rosasâ€™ teaching and new media studio work is concerned with issues of identity, inequality, irony and manipulation, and the various relationships within visual culture. Her most recent work is in music composition, collaborating with the visual work of partner Carlos Rosas, Penn State School of Visual Art, and the audio remixing of Robert Dansby, California Institute of the Arts. Much of the work resulting from their collaborations seeks to explore means in which one identifies with the continually evolving conditions within a technology-driven culture.
