Anna Divinsky is an instructor of art and the lead faculty of the Digital Arts Certificate Program offered by the School of Visual Arts and Penn State World Campus. In addition to teaching online, she oversees online training of new instructors and graduate assistants teaching in the program. Her goal is to foster close communication between the students and faculty. Being an artist inspires and informs her approach to how she authors and teaches online, integrating studio techniques and hands-on art making. She works primarily with fiber, creating paintings on silk, sculptural forms, and site-specific installations. Her love for pattern, design, intricate detail, and repetition is reflected in her course's requirements.
